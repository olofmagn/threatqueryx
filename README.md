#  ThreatQueryX - Multi-Platform Threat Hunting Query Builder
A cross-platform desktop GUI tool that helps security analysts build and customize threat hunting queries for platforms like:
- AQL (QRadar)
- Elasticsearch
- Microsoft Defender

The tool loads pre-defined YAML templates and allows you to select parameters such as IPs, ports, and time ranges—building valid queries dynamically without writing syntax by hand.

## 🚀 Features
-  Template-based Query Generation (via YAML files)
-  User-friendly GUI with tkinter
-  Dynamic Field Loading based on platform
-  Time Range Selection & Navigation
-  Platform-specific Output (AQL, KQL, Elastic DSL)
-  Validation of input fields (e.g., IPs, integers)
-  Easily extendable with new platforms/templates

## 🧾 Template Format (YAML)
Each includes, for example using `failed_logins` for the platform `qradar`:
```yaml
failed_logins:
  description: "Search for authentication failures with optional filters."
  base: "SELECT * FROM events"
  required_fields:
    - "logsourcename(logsourceid) ILIKE 'Windows%'"
    - "qidname(qid) = 'Authentication Failure'"
  optional_fields:
    username:
      pattern: "username = '{value}'"
      help: "The username to filter on (e.g., admin)"
    source_ip:
      pattern: "sourceip = '{value}'"
      help: "sourceip address of the login attempt"
      validation: "ip"
```

As indicated, `failed_logins` defines the template structure. The `required_fields` are necessary to optimize and enhance the effectiveness of the search, and they are typically defined by the implementer in the initial phase based on the template. The `optional_fields`, along with a `pattern`, are used to gather and hold additional input from the user to further enrich the search criteria. The variable `help` is to provide useful information about the purpose of each field. This is especially helpful when running the application in cli mode or during automation tasks. See section `Usage` for more details. Finally, `validation` is used to validate the field in the backend based on its characteristics.


## 🧩 Adding New Templates
Just add a new entry following the above structure to the YAML file under the appropriate platform (e.g., templates/elastic.yaml). No code changes needed.


## 🧠 Future Ideas
- Add integration with `yamlbuilder.py` to automate threat-hunting templates using ML/AI on a local setup.
- Save custom query profiles based on current threat-landscape that can be easily translated into queries.
